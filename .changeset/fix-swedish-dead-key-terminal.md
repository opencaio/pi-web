Fix dead-key/IME input in the terminal (e.g. typing `~` on a Swedish keyboard). The character previously stuck in the top-left corner and was never sent to the shell. The terminal panel now includes the xterm composition-view styles and no longer forces the helper textarea's position with `!important`, so dead-key composition is placed at the cursor and committed correctly.

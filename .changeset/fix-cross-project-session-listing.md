Fix sessions outside the server's launch directory being invisible: listing returned no sessions and opening them failed with 404 "Session not found", leaving the model picker empty. Working directories are now normalized at the API boundary and when reading stored session data, so path differences (trailing slashes, redundant segments, and Windows backslash vs forward-slash forms) no longer hide live or archived sessions. Requests with a relative `cwd` are now rejected with a 400 error instead of being resolved against the server's own working directory. Requires Pi coding agent SDK 0.78.0 or newer.
